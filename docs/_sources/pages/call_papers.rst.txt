Call for Papers 
======================

Participants and Focus
-------------------------

Built on the success of previous conferences in this series, LBS 2025 is addressed to scholars and researchers, digital industry / market operators, and students of different backgrounds (scientific, engineering and humanistic) whose work is either focused on or relevant to location-based services (LBS). The conference will offer a common ground to colleagues from various disciplines and practices where they can meet, interact and exchange knowledge, experience, plans and ideas on how LBS can and could be improved and on how it will influence both science and society.

Submissions
----------------

Full papers and work in progress papers should be submitted via `Conftool website <https://www.conftool.org/lbs2025/>`__. See more details below.

Full papers
*************

To present significant scientific results. Full papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed. High-quality submissions will be accepted for presentation at the conference. We are exploring the potential for a special issue after the conference, which will have a separate review process. Manuscripts must describe original work that has neither been published before nor is currently under review elsewhere. Papers should be written in English according to the `Word <https://github.com/LBS2025/lbs2025/raw/master/templates/lbs2025_word_template_v0.1.doc>`__ or `LaTex <https://github.com/LBS2025/lbs2025/raw/master/templates/LBS-template.zip>`__ template, and should not exceed 3000 words (including title, figures, and references). Full papers must be submitted in PDF format through the `Conftool website <https://www.conftool.org/lbs2025/>`__ **by 1.11.2024**.

Full paper submissions are anonymized. Do not include any information that could reveal your identity. The title section of your manuscript should not contain any author names, email addresses, or affiliation status. In the body of your submission, eliminate all direct references to your own previous work, i.e., you must discuss your own previous work as if it had been written by somebody else. Please do not disproportionately cite your own previous work. Thank you!

Work in progress
******************

To present ongoing work. Work-in-progress papers should include succinct and sufficient information about research objectives, significance, method, and preliminary or expected findings. If accepted (after review), you are either invited to give an oral or a poster presentation at the conference (decision by the program committee). Your work-in-progress paper will be published in the online proceedings of the conference (with a DOI). Work-in-progress papers (up to 1200 words, including title, figures, and references) must be written in English using the LBS 2025 `Word <https://github.com/LBS2025/lbs2025/raw/master/templates/lbs2025_word_template_v0.1.doc>`__ or `LaTex <https://github.com/LBS2025/lbs2025/raw/master/templates/LBS-template.zip>`__ template, and submitted in PDF format through the `Conftool website <https://www.conftool.org/lbs2025/>`__ **by 1.2.2025**. Please note that when submitting your contribution through the Conftool website, you should indicate the category (Full paper or Work in progress) you want to submit.

Showcases (pitch and demo)
***************************

Covers pitch session and live demonstrations of research prototypes and products. Showcase abstracts will be reviewed by the PC chairs and, if accepted, published in the online proceedings of the conference. Showcase abstracts should be in single-column, single-spaced with figures and tables within the text (up to 800 words) and submitted **via email to info@lbsconference.org by 15.2.2025**. Besides an introduction to the topic and project presented, showcase submissions must also include a description of the live presentation, including hardware and software used, space requirements, as well as information on what conference attendees will be able to see and try out during the demo session.
