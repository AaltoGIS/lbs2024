**Dr. Anahid (Ana) Basiri** is a Professor in Geospatial Data Science, a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellow, the Director of the Centre for Data Science and AI,
and the Royal Academy of Engineering's EngineeringX Champion at the University of Glasgow. Ana leads a team working on developing (theoretical and applied) solutions that
consider unavailability and biases in data as useful sources of data to make inferences about the underlying reasons that caused missingness or biases.
For this, she collaborates with world-leading academic, government, and industrial partners.

**Dr. Grant McKenzie** is an Associate Professor of Spatial Data Science in the Department of Geography at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. At McGill, Grant leads the
Platial Analysis Lab, an interdisciplinary research group that works at the intersection of information science and behavioral geography. Much of Grant's work examines
how human activity patterns vary within and between local regions and global communities. This has driven his applied interests geoprivacy and new mobility services as well as
the broader role that geographic information science plays at the intersection of information technologies and society. Outside of academia, Grant has worked as a data scientist
and software developer for a range of NGOs and leading technology companies.
