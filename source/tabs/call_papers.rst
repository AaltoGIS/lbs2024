Call for Papers 
======================

Participants and Focus
-------------------------

Built on the success of previous conferences in this series, LBS 2025 is addressed to scholars and researchers, digital industry / market operators, 
and students of different backgrounds (scientific, engineering and humanistic) whose work is either focused on or relevant to location based services (LBS). 
The conference will offer a common ground to colleagues from various disciplines and practices where they can meet, interact and exchange knowledge, experience, 
plans and ideas on how LBS can and could be improved and on how it will influence both science and society.
