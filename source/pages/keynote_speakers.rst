**Dr. Ana Basiri** is a Professor of Geospatial Data Science at the School of Geographical & Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow. Ana is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow,
the Editor in Chief of Journal of Navigation and Associate/Guest Editor of several high impact journals including IET Smart city and International Journal Geographical Information Science.
She leads an interdisciplinary team of researchers and collaborates with world-leading academic and industrial partners, including Ordnance Survey GB, Uber, Alan Turing Institute,
and engage with the public, policymakers, and government. Dr. Basiri has received several awards and prizes, including Women Role Model in Science by Alexander Humboldt and European
Commission Marie Curie Alumni. Ana works on developing (theoretical and applied) solutions to the challenges of 'new forms of data' such as missingness and biases.
These solutions are based on the mindset that considers the bias, missingness, or low quality as a useful source of data to make inference about the
underlying reasons for the missingness and bias. One application of this is extracting the 3D map of cities using the patterns of blockage, reflection,
and attenuation of the GPS signals (or other similar signals), that are contributed by the volunteers/crowd. In the era of big data, open data, social media, and
crowdsourced data when “we are drowning in data”, gaps and unavailability, representativeness, and bias issues associated with them may indicate some hidden problems
or reasons of biases and missingness.

**Dr. Grant McKenzie** is an Associate Professor of Spatial Data Science in the Department of Geography at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. At McGill, Grant leads the
Platial Analysis Lab, an interdisciplinary research group that works at the intersection of information science and behavioral geography. Much of Grant's work examines
how human activity patterns vary within and between local regions and global communities. This has driven his applied interests geoprivacy and new mobility services as well as
the broader role that geographic information science plays at the intersection of information technologies and society. Outside of academia, Grant has worked as a data scientist
and software developer for a range of NGOs and leading technology companies.

Dr. Heidi Kuusniemi is a professor in computer science and director of the Digital Economy research platform and the Kvarken Space Center at the University of Vaasa in Finland.
She is also a part-time research professor in satellite navigation at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute of the National Land Survey. She is the President of the Nordic
Institute of Navigation. She has a M.Sc. (Tech.) degree (with distinction) from 2002 and a D.Sc. (Tech.) degree from 2005 in information technology, respectively,
from Tampere University of Technology, Finland. Part of her doctoral research in 2003-2004 on navigation reliability was conducted at the University of Calgary,
Department of Geomatics Engineering, Canada. In 2017, she was a visiting scholar at Stanford University's GPS Laboratory. She served as a member of the council for natural
sciences and engineering at the Academy of Finland in 2019-2021 and is a member of the Finnish Academy of Technical Sciences since 2023. She was a member of the scientific
advisory committee for GNSS (GSAC) at the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2013-2020. Her technical expertise and interests include localization methods, GNSS reliability and
resilience, estimation and data fusion, mobile precision positioning and PNT in the new space economy.
